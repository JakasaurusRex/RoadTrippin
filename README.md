# Road Trippin' 🚗🏞🏝
Interactive Road Trip poster you can hang on your wall! Add pins for places you have been to and watch them light up! Check out my [blog posts](https://jakasaurusrex.github.io/CakeBlog/) to learn more about it!

## Repo Organization

There are only two files in the project. The file RoadTrippin.ino is the code that allows you to enable the lights connected to the poster when touching the ESP32's touch capacitive sensors! 

The other file, RoadTrippin.dxf, contains the laser cutting sketch I used to cut my map!

## The final product!!

## What is this? 🎨

This is an interactive poster made for the final project for Creative Embedded systems. We were tasked to use our knowledge and skills acquired by working with the ESP32 over the semester to design a project that has interactive features and sits in an enclosure. My goal was to create a interactive poster inspired by Crafted Stories by Irene Posch, a project that I investigated earlier in the semester for our related works project! The interactive poster would allow you to place pins on a map to chart out a roadtrip on a map of the east coast states. Placing pins in holes in states would light up the state indicating you had been there. All the technical components would be contained in the back of the poster and the ESP32 is contain at the bottom allowing for you to plug in the poster.

Here are some of the tools and materials that I used to create the project and what you would need to replicate it:  
- ESP32 TTGO T-display + USB-C Cable
- Plywood + Laser Cutter
- Adobe Illustrator for creating the sketch for cutting and scanning
- Soldering Iron and many wires for soldering
- Arudino IDEs
- Conductive Tape

## How to Build 🔨
1. Clone the repo!
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JakasaurusRex/RoadTrippin.git
```
2.  Download RoadTrippin.dxf or create your own sketch for cutting out the map!
3.  Laser cut and assemble the map! I used hot glue and tape to keep things in tact! Additionally, I cut out the states and then shrunk them and connected them together and cut again to create the multi-layered effect seen in my project!
4.  Design and setup your circuit for however many states you want to be able to light up. My ESP32 only had 7 touch capacitive sensors and 7 additional pins, so I could only light 7 states. 
5.  Hook up the circuitry to the map and setup the capacitive touch capabilties!
6.  Set up the poster for display and plug it in!


## How I made it! ⚙️✏️

This section will be divided into multiple unordered parts that all came together in the end:
- Designing the Map
- Desgining the Circuit
- Setting up the capacitive touch capabilities.
